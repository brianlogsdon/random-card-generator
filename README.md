  # Random Card Generator

A site that generates a random playing card on each refresh.
## About the Project
* Create and algorithm that randomly builds a card on every refresh:
* Every time the website refreshes a new random card needs to show
* The card must have one of the possible suites: Hearts, Spades, Clubs and Diamons.
* The card value must be one of the following: 1 to 10, King, Queen, Jack or Ace (no joker).
* In the end, the project needs to look similar to [this demo](https://projects.breatheco.de/json?slug=random-card&preview).
